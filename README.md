# harmon-TDMPC2: Rocket Landing with Harmony-TDMPC2

This repository demonstrates the application of the **harmony-TDMPC2** algorithm, a novel approach in reinforcement learning, to the challenging problem of rocket landing.

## Project Overview

We utilize harmony-TDMPC2 to train an agent capable of autonomously landing a rocket safely and efficiently. The algorithm's ability to handle complex dynamics and optimize control policies is showcased through simulated rocket landing scenarios.

## Visual Demonstration

The following GIFs illustrate the successful rocket landing process achieved by the harmony-TDMPC2 agent:
